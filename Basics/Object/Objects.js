//example:- 
let City_Name = ["Ahmedabad", "mumbai",  "delhi"];
console.log(City_Name[0]); //output: Ahmedabad
console.log(City_Name.length); //output: 3
// console.log(City_Name[3]); //output: undefined
// console.log(City_Name[2]); //output: delhi
// console.log(City_Name[1]); //output: mumbai
// console.log(City_Name); //output: ["Ahmedabad", "mumbai", "delhi"]
// console.log(City_Name[0] = "Bangalore"); //output: Bangalore
// console.log(City_Name); //output: ["Bangalore", "mumbai", "delhi]
